# Backend Projects Collection

This repository contains a collection of backend projects organized into chapters, each focusing on different backend concepts and implementations. It serves as a learning and reference resource for backend development using Node.js, Express, databases, authentication, and deployment techniques.

## Repository Overview

- **Chapter 1 - The Client and Network Theory**  
  Conceptual explanations about how clients, networks, and servers interact on the internet. (See `chapter_1/theory.md`)

- **Chapter 2 - Simple Express Backend Server**  
  A basic backend server using Express.js with simple API endpoints and middleware.

- **Chapter 3 - Full Stack Todo Application**  
  A full stack todo app with Node.js backend, SQLite database, JWT authentication, and frontend served from the backend.

- **Chapter 4 - Dockerized Full Stack Todo Application**  
  An advanced version of the todo app with PostgreSQL, Prisma ORM, JWT authentication, and Docker support for containerized deployment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (recommended version 16 or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
